# Team of Experts (TOE)

A multi-agent system for building complex software projects by assembling specialized AI agents.

## Overview

This repository contains agent definitions for a Director-led team of specialized AI experts. The Director orchestrates complex software projects by hiring and coordinating agents with specific expertise.

## Available Agents

### Core Team
- **Director** - Orchestrates projects, hires and coordinates specialized agents
- **Researcher** - Investigates technologies, best practices, and design patterns
- **Project Manager** - Creates project plans, timelines, and manages milestones
- **Designer** - Designs system architecture, UI/UX, and data models
- **Developer** - Implements features and writes code
- **QA Engineer** - Tests software for quality, bugs, and compliance
- **Documentation Specialist** - Creates user guides, API docs, and technical documentation

### Specialized Team
- **Database Engineer** - Designs databases, optimizes queries, manages schemas
- **DevOps** - Manages infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployments
- **Data Engineer** - Builds ETL pipelines, data processing workflows
- **Security Engineer** - Performs security audits, compliance checks, penetration testing
- **Marketing** - Handles product messaging, launches, and content creation

## How It Works

1. **User Request** - Describe what you need built
2. **Director Analysis** - Director understands requirements and determines approach
3. **Team Assembly** - Director hires the right specialists for the job
4. **Coordination** - Director manages handoffs, dependencies, and parallel work
5. **Delivery** - Completed project with all artifacts, tests, and documentation

## Key Principles

- **Delegation Over Implementation** - Director never writes code, only coordinates
- **Specialized Expertise** - Each agent is an expert in their domain
- **Clear Handoffs** - Work products flow seamlessly between agents
- **Quality Focus** - Testing and documentation are first-class concerns

## Usage

These agent definitions are designed for use with AI agent orchestration systems that support multi-agent workflows and specialized agent roles.
